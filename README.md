# 🔐 SSH Harden Automation

A Bash automation script that secures an OpenSSH server by applying essential SSH hardening techniques automatically.

This project demonstrates Linux administration, Bash scripting, configuration management, and security automation.

---

## Features

- Verify root privileges
- Verify SSH service installation
- Create timestamped backup of `sshd_config`
- Read existing SSH configuration
- Display current SSH security settings
- Apply secure SSH defaults when configuration is absent
- Preserve original configuration through automatic backups

---

## Security Controls Applied

| Configuration | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| SSH Port | 2222 |
| PermitRootLogin | No |
| PasswordAuthentication | No |
| PubkeyAuthentication | Yes |

These changes help reduce the attack surface and encourage key-based authentication.
